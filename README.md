### ******************   WeatherPy Part I    ******************
#### Observations
* 'Northern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regressions' shows a negative correlation. As we move away from the equatore the temperature decreases.
* 'Southern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression' shows a positive correlation. As we get closer to the equator the temperature increases.
* Both, Humidity(%) and Wind Speed vs. Latitude Linear Regressions for the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres do not display much of a correlation between the data sets.
